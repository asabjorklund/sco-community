This page should be left blank intentionally, and any text here will be ignored. The purpose is to define the `default.html` layout to be used as the main page instead of the `_layouts/markdown.html` one. In addition, the `_layouts/default.html` layout utilises the `group` parameter to decide which other pages to include. Since this is the **Home** page group, then the `_includes/Home.html` file will be included as the main page.
