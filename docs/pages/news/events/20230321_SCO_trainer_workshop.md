## Workshop for Single-Cell Omics data analysis trainers

*21-23 March 2023, Geneva*

GOBLET[^1] and ELIXIR[^2] co-organized a workshop in 2021 to bring together single-cell RNA-seq data analysis trainers to share experiences, challenges and best practices. The newly established ELIXIR Single-Cell Omics (SCO) Community together with GOBLET would like to pursue this effort and equip SCO trainers with the best FAIR and open research tools, materials and practices to be able to teach and upskill scientists in SCO data analysis and standards.

The aim of this workshop is to get SCO data analysis trainers, members of the community and beyond together, for exchanging ideas about best practices, methods and datasets. A survey will be run before the workshop to serve as a basis for discussion. The workshop will be divided into sessions, each representing a topic of interest. Participants will have the opportunity to discuss the training aspects of the management of different types of SCO data, the diversity of analysis tools and methods, as well as  computational environments,  datasets and standards currently used. The workshop discussions will also aim to address what works well and what is challenging when teaching, what is actually missing in SCO training, and how it could be expanded and improved in the near future. This workshop will also be the occasion to bring on board any ELIXIR Node members interested in developing and offering SCO training. Following this workshop, on 22-26 May 2023, a pedagogical training will also be offered in the form of the ELIXIR Train-the-Trainer (TtT) course online.
