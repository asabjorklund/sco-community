# Identifying the most appropriate and performant analysis tools

A plethora of SCO tools exist, and yet standards on how to benchmark or evaluate the accuracy of each tool are lacking. Furthermore, most benchmark efforts are focused on certain cell types or tissues.

- The first goal is the identification of a few scRNA-seq datasets for developing the rules to be used for defining datasets suitable to become benchmarking cases. We aim to create a central pipeline to benchmark SCO tools and define standard datasets for such benchmarks. The outcomes of benchmarking and software challenges allow data scientists to make an informed decision on the software to be used in their analytical workflows.
- To facilitate findability and usability, we aim to contribute to tool registries and provide portable software environments of the most commonly used tools/workflows.
- In the long term, we aim to provide cloud deployable analysis pipelines that utilise Galaxy and Chipster platforms, as well as providing curated datasets for user driven benchmark on the OpenEBench infrastructure.
