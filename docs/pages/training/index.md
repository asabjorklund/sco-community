# Training in Single-Cell and Spatial Omics

- We will connect existing materials to compile a comprehensive collection of training materials, datasets and guidelines on how to teach for trainers and learners.
- We will adopt both top down and bottom up approaches via:
Trainer the Trainer (TtT) workshops for exchanging ideas about best practices, methods and datasets, and offering advance training courses and compiling video catalogue of training material to enable self-study and asynchronous learning for researchers.
- In the long term we aim to utilise ELIXIR TeSS to establish a well-curated ELIXIR SCO training portal, listing national and international bodies, web resources and upcoming training events.
