# Building capacity in Single-Cell and Spatial Omics

<br>

## Our Goals

Our main goals regarding training are:

<br>

_"Upskilling scientists in SCO data analysis and standards lies at the heart of the ELIXIR SCO Community, and particular efforts will be made to make the training scalable and FAIR in coordination with the ELIXIR Training platform. The SCO Community will ensure that training materials and expertise are shared efficiently and following FAIR and open research principles. We will collaborate with ELIXIRâ€™s Training Portal TeSS65 to establish a well-curated SCO training portal, listing national and international training providers, web resources and upcoming training events."_ [^1]

<br>

Please refer to our white paper[^1], where we describe and identify the challenges related to training in Single-Cell and Spatial Omics, and how our community will help fill those needs.
